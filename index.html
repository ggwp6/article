            Subnets are logical divisions of an existing network that are
            defined by both class of IP address and the subnet mask. Often,
            consultants provide network design services to budding businesses to
            help establish a network that fits their needs at the time. But as
            the business grows or its needs change there may come a time when
            the initial network structure no longer works.

            many devices and users to accommodate. As the needs of the business
            grew, it became painfully obvious that a single /24 subnet that
            accommodates up to 254 hosts wasnt enough anymore. So Im building
            out a new network structure that can accommodate all of the devices

            bit intimidated by subnetting simply because they don't want to
            bother with the work it takes to implement it. How many addresses do
            we need? What IP scheme are we going to use? How many addresses will
            be given with DHCP and how many assigned statically? Will we
            separate out the types of devices or simply place them in a certain
            section of the range (such as putting all servers in the first 50
            addresses of a range)?

            When subnetting you are using a subnet mask to steal bits from the
            host portion of an address and adding them to the network portion to
            tailor the number of hosts you can accommodate. A subnet mask is a
            32-bit number like an IP address, but instead of being used for host
            addressing, its purpose is to communicate the portions of a network
            address that are network/subnet bits and the portions that are host
            bits. Subnet masks are constructed by setting all of the host bits
            to 0 and all of the network/subnet bits to 1.

            Because there are 32 total bits in an IPv4 address (eight in each of

            particular mask you subtract the number of network bits and subnet
            bits from 32 and raise 2 to the power of the difference. For
            example, for a /22 network the number of host addresses would be 32
            - 22 = 10, 210 = 1024 addresses. This chart shows the number of host

            When subnetting a network it is easy to think that because you have
            x devices on your network you just need to pick an IP range and
            subnet that has enough addresses to account for all devices, but
            that would be leaving out some key considerations. By creating a
            mega subnet, like say a /8 with 16,777,216 addresses, you begin to
            run into network congestion issues. Because each subnet is its own
            broadcast domain, whenever a switch sends an ARP broadcast or a
            machine is broadcasting something else, every device in the
            broadcast domain will get it. As a result, broadcast packets on your
            network can drown out actual non-broadcast traffic.

            256-1024 or fewer addresses, but any bigger, and you are in serious
            trouble depending on how noisy your devices are. Best practice is
            usually to separate some of the main categories of devices on your
            network into their own subnets or broadcast domains with VLANs. By
            doing this with some kind of Layer 3 device to route traffic between
            subnets you can still have as many addresses as you need, but the

            A point-to-point subnet is a particular type of subnet used in
            point-to-point links that facilitate direct communication between
            two routers. This subnet consists of a 31-bit subnet mask, leaving
            only two possible addresses in the network. Since point-to-point
            subnets contain only one host, a different broadcast address isnt
            necessary.

            When a device broadcasts a packet, it'll reach all the network
            devices, burdening the network. Without proper context, broadcast
            packets can also spam devices within the network. This can lead to
            degraded network performance. By creating subnets, you can limit the
            scope of intranetwork broadcast messages to a specific subnet. This
            also enables efficient communication between devices in a subnet and
            sends a packet for routing outside the subnet if a destination

            A subnet is just a range of IP addresses. All the devices in the
            same subnet can communicate directly with one another without going
            through any routers. In IPv4, a network interface is connected to

            slightly more complicated, so we'll save IPv6 subnetting for another
